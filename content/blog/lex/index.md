I had free time, and did not feel social enough to talk to people, or waste time on social media, so 
I started learning how to build bots.

```bash
npm install -g @aws/amplify
amplify configgure 
npx create-react-app q-bot
cd q-bot
amplify init
amplify add hosting
amplify publish
amplify add interactions
amplify push
```
